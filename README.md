# SMM4H 2022 Task 8: Classification of self-reported chronic stress on Twitter (in English)

## Overview 

Chronic stress is defined as the physiological or psychological response to a prolonged internal or external stressful event (i.e., a stressor), which can lead to poor mental health, including depression and anxiety, and can also take a toll on the body, resulting in the dysfunctions of cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, and immuno-inflammatory systems. Traditional methods of assessing stress, including interviews, questionnaires/surveys, etc., have some limitations in accurately measuring population-level stress. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative chronic stress assessment methods. Social media are potentially valuable resources for studying chronic stress and its characteristics, and the first step is to accurately detect the tweets that are self-disclosures of chronic stress. In this task, about 37% of the tweets are positive (self-disclosure of chronic stress, P) and 63% are negative (non-self-disclosure of chronic stress, N). Systems designed for this task need to automatically identify tweets in the self-disclosure category. Classifier evaluation will be based on the F1 score over the positive class.
